    <h2>About PassZero</h2>

    <p>Remembering passwords is hard. That's why most people either use the same password for every site, or tend to use extremely insecure password. And how often do you forget your password? For me, it was all the time. That's why I wrote PassZero.</p>

    <p>PassZero is a password manager: you can save the passwords for all your accounts on PassZero, and only need to remember one password. The passwords are securely encrypted with <b>your master password</b> so that they are completely secure, even if someone were to break into the PassZero servers.</p>

                    Your data is encrypted with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa20">Salsa20</a>, a powerful modern stream cipher that is also <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9001">used in the new QUIC protocol</a>.
                    The encryption key is derived from your private key, so only you have access to your data. Not even the PassZero team can decrypt it.
                    Even in the unlikely event that hackers access our database, your data will still be secure.

        <h2>Encryption Details</h2>
        <p>PassZero encrypts each individual entry using the modern <a href="https://nacl.cr.yp.to/">NaCl cryptographic library</a>.
        Each entry is encrypted with the XSalsa20 stream cipher and authenticated using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly1305">Poly1305 MAC</a> (thank you Daniel Bernstein).
        Each entry is encrypted with its own key, derived from the master key using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2">Argon2id KDF</a>.
        Argon2id is a memory-hard key derivation function, which means it's both resistant to side-channel attacks and brute-force cost savings due to time-memory tradeoffs. For more details see the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-argon2/13/">IETF Draft</a>.</p>
